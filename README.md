👋 Hi, I'm Nidhi D B!

I'm a student exploring the world of programming and technology. My current focus is on learning:
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): To understand problem-solving techniques.
- Data Analysis: To turn data into meaningful insights using Python and other tools.

🌟 My journey so far:
- I'm solving beginner problems on [platforms like LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks].
- Experimenting with small projects to improve my skills.

🎯 Goals:
- Build a strong foundation in DSA.
- Create simple data analysis projects.

📚 Learning one step at a time, and excited to grow! Feel free to check out my repositories to follow my progress.
