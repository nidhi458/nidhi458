ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nidhi D B!

I'm a student exploring the world of programming and technology. My current focus is on learning:
- Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (DSA): To understand problem-solving techniques.
- Data Science: Trying to explore the concepts

ðŸŒŸ My journey so far:
- I'm solving beginner problems on [platforms like LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks].
- Experimenting with small projects to improve my skills.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Build a strong foundation in DSA.

ðŸ“š Learning one step at a time, and excited to grow! Feel free to check out my repositories to follow my progress.
